# Chorer

The frontend for the Chorer chore management tracker software, developed using Next.js. More information about it is available [here](https://doe.lc/project/chorer).

The API is available in a separate repository, at [sd0e/chorer-api](https://github.com/sd0e/chorer-api).

There is no live host of Chorer as I do not have a running instance of the API.

## Development

Clone this repository and run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to start the development server. Add the URL of the locally hosted API in the format `API_URL=http://localhost:5000`, and change the Firebase settings to use your project.

## Deployment

Add the API URL to the .env file in the deployment.
